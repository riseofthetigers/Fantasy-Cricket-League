We developed a Web Application for VESIT Cricket League which gives latest results of the matches, upcoming fixtures, league stats, league table and users can also play a fantasy league online in which  they can form their own team online, strategically using the player statistics. The results of their selected teams are then displayed after every match based on how the player they selected in their team, performed in the actual match.
